suneido_tests
=============

Portable tests for Suneido implementations.

Tests are defined in text files.
They are read with the Suneido lexer.

Currently, there are implementations in jSuneido, gSuneido,
and in Suneido (stdlib) itself.

Fixtures must be defined in each implementation for each type of test,
usually along with the other unit test code.
